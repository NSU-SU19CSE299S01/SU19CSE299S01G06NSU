  <h2 align="center"> Project Details</h2>
  <p>
  In this project, we are going to build a social media platform whose purpose would be to help enhance the user's career and professional life. We will be building a website (and subsequently an app) that would be geared towards people who are trying to build a better online portfolio for their career advancement.<br><br>
We have noticed that some of the social media platforms like Facebook, messenger, and WhatsApp are being used in the workplace for some specific tasks to some degree. But that process is thoroughly inefficient as those platforms were not made to be used for professional use and in reality, they were made for user's entertainment.<br><br>
Although there are some social media “ish” website and web apps that are tailor-made for professional and business use, for example, Linkedin and slack. But we believe they also lack in some aspects such as not being a proper social media platform.
That is why we are trying to combine the popular features found in the existing social media websites and apps and implement them on our website so that they can be used for professional use.<br><br>
By using our website, the users will be able to make a professional profile showcasing their background and accomplishments. Companies will be able to showcase their information and job circulars. The users will be able to find jobs via our website. There will be a way of communicating with other users through a chatting option. There are also some other features that have been described in detail below.

</p>
  The essential features of our product are the following:
  <p>
  <h3> Newsfeed</h3>
  The user will have his/her personalized newsfeed showing the articles and posts about the topics he/she was interested in and they have seen and liked before. Other users can make posts and the primary user can see what other users have posted in their newsfeed in minified Card format. Whenever they click on the card they will be taken to a page with the full post. 

<h3> Chat app</h3>
  Of course, no social media site is complete without some form of chatting option. On our website, there will be a chatting option where the user can have conversations with each other. Provided that both users are logged in, they will be able see which users are online and message them plain texts. The users can also share files and images too.
  
<h3> General Profile</h3>
The users will be able to build their profile in the format of their CV. So that their profile link can be used as a substitute for their CV. Also, there will be a part in their profile where they can showcase their projects using snapshots, .ppt files and pdf files. The user profile will have a verified review option where the other employees of the companies he/she worked in and his/her employers can post a review about the user’s performance and work ethic.

<h3>Company profile</h3>
The company profile will be different from a user profile. This will have the company's essential information and their projects and accomplishments. There will be a verified review option from the company’s employers and the other companies who have collaborated with them.

<h3>A place for a startup project idea </h3>
There will be a page where the users can post a detailed startup project idea to gain investment and resources from the different companies and even from other users from this social media platform.
